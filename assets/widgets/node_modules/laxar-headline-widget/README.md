## Appearance

The style of the widget elements are mostly affected by the theme which defines the rendering of the headline and default HTML elements.

## Usage

### Installation

For installation instruction take a look at the [LaxarJS documentation](http://laxarjs.org/docs/laxar-v2-latest/manuals/installing_widgets/).


### Configuration example

```json
{
   "widget": "laxar-headline-widget",
   "features": {
      "headline": {
         "level": 4,
         "i18nHtmlText": {
            "en-US": "Headline",
            "de-DE": "Ãœberschrift"
         }
      },
      "intro": {
         "i18nHtmlText": {
            "en-US": "This is a intro text.",
            "de-DE": "Dies ist ein Introtext."
         }
      },
      "buttons": [
         {
            "action": "doSomething",
            "enabled": true,
            "i18nHtmlLabel": {
               "en-US": "Cancel",
               "de-DE": "Abbrechen"
            }
         }
      ]
   }
}
```
Use this configuration on a page to get an laxar-headline-widget instance with a headline, an intro and a button on the right side of the headline.
If the button is pressed the widget publishes a `takeActionRequest.doSomething` event.


For full configuration options refer to the [widget.json](widget.json).


## Features

### 1. Display a Headline (headline)

*R1.1* The widget MUST display the configured headline text in a headline element.
The configured text MUST be interpreted as internationalized HTML content.

*R1.2* If no headline text is configured, the widget MUST NOT render a headline element.

*R1.3* The headline level MUST be configurable.
The level MUST be in the range from 1 to 6.


### 2. Display an Intro Text (intro)

*R2.1* The widget MUST display the configured intro text after the headline element.
The configured text MUST be interpreted as internationalized HTML content.


### 3. Display Buttons (buttons)

*R3.1* The widget MUST display configured buttons.

*R3.2* The configured buttons MUST be set to the right of the headline and grouped and aligned to the right.
Alternative enabled through configuration a button MUST be set to the left of the headline.

*R3.3* The widget MUST display a default space between the buttons.
The width of the space is defined by the theme.

*R3.4* If the available space is not enough, the button group SHOULD be wrapped automatically.
In every row each button group part SHOULD be aligned to the right.

*R3.5* It MUST be possible to enable or disable each button by configuration.

*R3.6* Each button text MUST be configurable.
The configured text MUST be interpreted as internationalized HTML content.
It MUST be possible to use icons as labels.

*R3.7* For each button an *access key* MUST be configurable to allow the control by keyboard.

*R3.8* For each button the position MUST be configurable.
The buttons position MUST be determined by the configured zero based index and the position of the button configuration.

*R3.9* The widget MUST allow the configuration of the button class (normal, primary, info, success, warning, danger, inverse, link).

*R3.10* The *size* of a button (mini, small, default, large) MUST be configurable.

*R3.11* Each button MUST have a *state* (disabled, hidden, omitted or normal).
The state of a button MUST depend on the page state (signaled with flags).
If several flags are defined for a state, the state MUST be activated when one flag is at least true.

*R3.12* In relation to the page state (signaled with flags, e.g. while a action is performed) a spinner SHOULD be displayed.
In this case a CSS class *is-busy* MUST be set to allow to change the label with a spinner.

*R3.13* Each button MUST have an unique page wide ID.
When a button or it's associated `access key` is pressed the widget MUST publish a `takeActionRequest` event with a key `anchorDomElement` with the ID of the button as value.

*R3.14* The widget MUST add the CSS class `ax-active` to a button while the appropriate action is being processed.


### 4. Support Internationalization (i18n)

*R4.1* The widget MUST allow the configuration of a *locale* as described in the documentation to [LaxarJS i18n]. When displaying internationalized content, the widget MUST use the current language tag of the locale.


## Integration

### Patterns

The widget supports the following event patterns as specified by the [LaxarJS Patterns] document.


#### Actions

* Action: `buttons.*.action`
   * Role: Sender
   * Description: Publish a `takeActionRequest` event if a button is pressed (or activated by an `access key`).


#### Flags

* Flag: `didChangeFlag.{features.*.omitOn|hideOn|disableOn|busyOn}.{true|false}`
   * Role: Receiver
   * Description: Determines the state of a button (hide or disable etc.).
